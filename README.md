# Work still in progress

# Description
This is a modified version of [reaper-sid's Chordgun script](https://github.com/reaper-sid/ChordGun)

Besides changes made to the original pandabot's script by reaper-sid (such as midi text events with key changes and chords, and buttons for saving the key and switching the notes off) I made several modifications.

The modifications were made with orchestral composition in mind, which is the way i use it.

# Changes
- Redesigned graphics enabling faster orientation in the script (may not be looking good, but it works)
- There is added space to put new chords (each degree now has two columns)
- Added new chords
- Added new scales
- "Save Key" button renamed to "Mark Key"
- Text events contain also degree scale information

# Known issues
- Graphics need some more work, especially in the scale selection part
- Scale degree in text events does not contain additional info about chord type (7th, add11, etc.)

# Future plans
- Make a filter for the chord types
